            <p class="leading-relaxed">At foot of the Black Cuillins near Glenbrittle are the Fairy Pools, beautifully crystal clear blue pools on the River Brittle.On a sunny day, the turquoise waters of the natural pools are so clear, one can readily see each moss-covered stone at the bottom. The area is also host to a large number of birds. Large flocks of crows, ravens, and gulls are present in the area, as well as such smaller birds as meadow pipits, turnstones, common ringed plovers, grey herons, dunlins, and curlews. The physical landscape is predominantly rocky, with some boggy areas here and there. The water in the area is typically cold, as the pools are fed by mountain streams. The waters of the Fairy Pools might be bone-chillingly cold, but their near supernatural atmosphere has made them one of Scotlandâ€™s most enduring natural wonders.</p>
